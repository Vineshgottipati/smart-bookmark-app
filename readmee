Smart Bookmark App

Author: Vinesh Gottipati
Tech Stack: Next.js (App Router), Supabase (Authentication, Database, Realtime), Tailwind CSS
Deployment: Vercel

Project Overview

The Smart Bookmark App is a full-stack web application that allows users to securely manage their bookmarks.

Users can:

Sign in using Google Authentication

Add bookmarks (title and URL)

View bookmarks instantly

Open bookmarks in a new tab

Delete bookmarks

Access only their own data

Row Level Security (RLS) ensures that users can only access and manage their own bookmarks.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js (App Router)

Backend and Database: Supabase

Authentication: Google OAuth via Supabase

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Deployment: Vercel

Version Control: Git and GitHub

Authentication

Google OAuth was configured using Google Cloud Console.

Client ID and Client Secret were added to Supabase

Supabase handles session management

Auth state changes are monitored using onAuthStateChange

Row Level Security ensures secure access to user-specific data

Database Structure

Table: bookmarks

Column	Type
id	uuid
title	text
url	text
user_id	uuid
created_at	timestamp

Row Level Security Policy:

auth.uid() = user_id


This ensures users can only insert, read, and delete their own records.

Features

Secure Google authentication

Real-time bookmark updates

Automatic session handling

Secure logout

Responsive UI

Production deployment on Vercel

Problems Faced and Solutions
1. Logout Button Not Working

Problem:
Logout did not redirect properly.

Cause:
Auth state change was not handled correctly.

Solution:
Used:

await supabase.auth.signOut()
window.location.href = '/login'


and properly implemented the onAuthStateChange listener.

2. Bookmarks Not Updating Without Refresh

Problem:
New bookmarks appeared only after manually refreshing the page.

Cause:
Component state was not updated after inserting data.

Solution:
Called fetchBookmarks(user.id) immediately after a successful insert.

3. Automatic Logout After Refresh

Problem:
User session was lost after refreshing the page.

Cause:
Session was not fetched on component mount.

Solution:
Added:

const { data } = await supabase.auth.getSession()


inside useEffect.

4. GitHub Authentication Error

Problem:
GitHub rejected password-based authentication.

Cause:
GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations.

Solution:
Created a Personal Access Token (PAT) and used it instead of a password.

5. Vercel Deployment Failed – “supabaseUrl is required”

Problem:
Build failed during deployment.

Cause:
Environment variables were not configured in Vercel.

Solution:
Added the following environment variables in Vercel Project Settings:

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

6. Next.js Build Error – “use client directive must be placed before other expressions”

Problem:
Build failed during production deployment.

Cause:
The "use client" directive was not placed at the top of the file.

Solution:
Moved it to the first line of the file:

'use client'
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"

7. Google OAuth Error – “Unsupported provider: missing OAuth secret”

Problem:
Google login failed.

Cause:
OAuth Client Secret was not configured in Supabase.

Solution:
Added the correct Client ID and Client Secret in:

Supabase → Authentication → Providers → Google
